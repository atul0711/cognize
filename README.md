Universal language chat app with translation capabilities

This project will be written in flask as POC. We will be starting with implementing a chatroom kind of an appication for starters. 

User story:
1. As a user to a chat room, I sometimes find it difficult to understand the chats in a chatroom if the conversations going on are in some other language that I speak. 
A simple appliaction that can in realtime translate the chats coming to me in my own preffered language would be a boon for me.

2. As a business owner I sometimes have to deal with clients not speaking my language. This becomes a hurdel in smooth transactions. Additionally if I have such an app that can simply translate the incoming chats to my preffered language, then I can hit different markets in the world without a language barrier

3. As a person having a pen friend from another country who doesn't speak your languagae, it becomes tiresome to copy and paste each others chats to translator apps for understading each other. A chat app which can in realtime translate both the chats into the language preffered by the receiver, will be helpful.
